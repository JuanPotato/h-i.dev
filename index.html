    <h1>Hi, I'm Hasan Ibraheem</h1>
    <p class="st">
        I am an organizer with <a href="https://notechforapartheid.com/">No Tech For Apartheid</a>.
        Google fired me after I participated in a sit-in calling for Project Nimbus to be dropped.
    </p>
    <h2>What is Project Nimbus?</h2>
    <p>
        Projct Nimbus is a <b>1.2 billion dollar</b> contract between Google, Amazon, and the israeli military to
        provide
        cloud and AI infrastructure <a
            href="https://time.com/6966102/google-contract-israel-defense-ministry-gaza-war/">(Time Magazine)</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Besides being used by the military, multiple israeli weapons manufacturers and other government branches are
        <b>required</b> to use Google or Amazon through Project Nimbus <a
            href="https://theintercept.com/2024/05/01/google-amazon-nimbus-israel-weapons-arms-gaza/">(The
            Intercept)</a>
    </p>
    <p>I didn't want to work for a company directly aiding in genocide against Palestine, so I spoke up against it.</p>
    <p><b>Google is not only complicit, but is directly fueling this AI powered genocide.</b></p>
    <h2>What happened in the sit-in?</h2>
    <p>On 4/16/2024, nine Google employees (me included) were arrested in Sunnyvale and New York. Those in
        Sunnyvale were sitting in Thomas Kurian's office, the Google Cloud CEO. Meanwhile those of us in NYC were
        sitting in a common working area. We were there for around ten hours before being arrested for tresspassing.</p>
    <p>Google retaliated by firing over 50 employees, some of which had nothing to do with the sit-in. You can hear more
        about it in our <a href="https://notechforapartheid.com/pressconference">press conference</a> we held.</p>
    <h2>How are you?</h2>
    <p>I'm feeling great to no longer work at a company supporting genocide.</p>
